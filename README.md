# online-job-portal
Unemployment is one of the significant social issues faced by both developing and developed countries.
One of the reasons for this problem is the unfair distribution or lack of information on job opportunities
due to which many people are unable to find out about new job vacancies.
The above has never been more relevant than today with a pandemic causing mass unemployment and
desperate candidates hunting for jobs to no avail.
The objective of this project is to create a completely functional interface for candidates that are
looking for job opportunities in different sectors and make the entire process of applying for jobs easier
not only for the candidates but also for the employers.


Outline

At its core the project will consist of 3 interfaces one would be addressed towards the Hiring companies
(called the employers) and the second would be potential employment seekers (called applicants or job
seekers) and third would be the website administrators who would be responsible for managing all the
employers and job seekers.
Companies can create an employer account to post jobs on the portal. Their account will require
validation from the admin after which they can upload job details, and can edit their vacancies as well,
schedule interviews and review individual applicant information.
All the employers can view all the applications in their dashboards and can select or reject an applicant
by filtering based on their profile. Whenever an applicant is selected or rejected for the job or for further
rounds, they receive information about the interview timings and other details.
The applicants (job seekers) can see the job details and get to know about the latest news, they can filter
jobs based on their interest, they can update the portfolio details including education, resume. They can
check their schedule for walkin interviews and can give feedback about a particular employer or the
website which can help the admin better manage the portal.
The administrator has privileges to allow a particular job seeker or employer to use the website as well
as to add new administrators. They can create news posts which will be visible to all users even if they
donâ€™t log in to the website.


Software Stack

We will be using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MySQL to provide all the features mentioned above and
aim for the portal to be an all inclusive place for job seekers and employers to reduce the hassle involved
in searching for a new job.
